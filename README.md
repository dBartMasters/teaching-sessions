notebooks and code for teaching series to IT group

## The ask
In April of 2019, I was approached by several members of our IT/engineering group within PerkinElmer who were interested in doing more with machine learning and data science.<br>
They asked me to lead some sessions to introduce them to data science and machine learning concepts from a pratical standpoint. This group learned as much as they could from wikipedia, and we excellent at learning the coding techniques, but needed some "tips, tricks, and cautions" that come from pracical experience.
I put together 3 sessions and presented these to a diverse group data science enthusiasts within PerkinElmer.
